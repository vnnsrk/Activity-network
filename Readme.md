# Activity network

Work submitted for ECE 289 final project - 
Underlines the differences between an activity network and an ego network, and why we should study the pair-activity rather than links / friendships between people in a social network. Gained intuitive results like how we fail to keep in touch with people after we send them requests, and how our close circle of friends is formed. Carries insights into hierarchical friendships or connectivity, and the small-world phenomenon.
